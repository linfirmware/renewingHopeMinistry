  <p>2016 Conference Verse: My Help Comes from the Lord
A Song of Ascents.</p>

<p><small>1</small> I lift up my eyes to the hills.
    From where does my help come?
<small>2</small> My help comes from the Lord,
    who made heaven and earth.
<small>3</small> He will not let your foot be moved;
    he who keeps you will not slumber.
<small>4</small> Behold, he who keeps Israel
    will neither slumber nor sleep.
<small>5</small> The Lord is your keeper;
    the Lord is your shade on your right hand.
<small>6</small> The sun shall not strike you by day,
    nor the moon by night.
<small>7</small> The Lord will keep you from all evil;
    he will keep your life.
<small>8</small> The Lord will keep
    your going out and your coming in
    from this time forth and forevermore.</p>

    <p><em>- Psalm 121:1-8 (ESV)</em></p>
